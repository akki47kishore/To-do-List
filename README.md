# To-do-List

A user can insert a list of items as to do, e.g Buy Candles. For each 'to do', the app searches the catalogue and finds a set of items that match the description, from which the user can handpick the required item. It then moves the items to the cart one by one. Finally the user reaches a blling page where the final cost after discount is calculated.
